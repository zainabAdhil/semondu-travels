## About the project
This is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based travel website crafted without dependency on frameworks. This website is developed in collaboration with an IT company. this project was part of my freelance design services offered through my startup, Innoweb Solutions. Following the company's request for website coding, we opted for hard-coded CSS for this website design instead of our usual Figma approach.
